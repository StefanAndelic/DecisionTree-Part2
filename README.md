DecisionTree machine learning algorithm and its evaluation on 10 other pairs of training and test files that were constructed by a seed generator which splits the files into 100 and 37 instances respectively. 

This repository contains code for a DecisionTree algorithm using Gini Impurity measure written in Java which tests the classifier on each pair and calculates the average accuracy of the classifiers over the 10 iterations. 

The code can be executed through CLI by entering the file name followed by designated training and test files (e.g. java -jar DecisionTree_Part2.jar hepatitis-training-run hepatitis-test-run). Alternatively, DecisionTree_Part2.jar file or the source code provided in the repository can be imported into a Java IDE (e.g. eclipse).
